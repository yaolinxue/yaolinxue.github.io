## Hello nerds

I code on occasion, believe it or not. My latest deal is I'm making as many useful things with Java and Github as humanly possible. I also have some non-coding things that I update on occasion, for example my blog repo.

And I have a bady son named Zexi Li, so I have to work hard now.

Wish you have a nice day.
